### Project Aquascape minder:

A healthy aquarium with all natural aqua scape has precision controlled parameters. While the marine life can sustain some aberrations , it is best to have close control over the water body parameters. We have also made an attempt to keep all the items in the aquarium natural with minimum interference from plastic or non biological items.

Here is what our water body has now , not very diverse marine life.

|Item|Quantity|
|-----|-----|
|Serphae Tetra fish|11|
|Chinese golden algae eater|2|
|Neon Tetra fish|12|
|Green ring turtle|1|

All the enlisted are tropical life and tolerate a temperature of about 21<sup>o</sup>C to about 27<sup>o</sup>C, 6hours of LED light :4 Watts, and aeration of approximately 6 hours.

While aquarists would argue that this is not much of a task switching off / on certain accessories of the aquariums at any time during the day, automation systems allow you a chance to monitor higher parameters taking control of the drudgery of keeping a schedule clock of the aquarium. One may realize how vital this is when away from the aquarium.
